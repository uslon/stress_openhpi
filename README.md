# stress_openhpi
This project was inspired by [OpenHPI testing project](https://github.com/open-hpi/hpib-test) 
which main purpose was to check reliability and correctness of OpenHPI implementation. Here you can find stress tests and get statistics about 
CPU time consumption and memory usage.

1. Before using this app install OpenHPI or prepare custom implementation.
2. Build and run program as ordinary CMake project.
